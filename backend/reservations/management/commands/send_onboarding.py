        BleepBloopBleep, this is the Room Service RoomBaht for Room Swaps letting you know the floors have been cleaned and you have been assigned a room. No bucket or mop needed.

        After you login below you can view your current room, look at other rooms and send trade requests. This functionality is only available until Monday 11/7 at 5pm PST, so please make sure you are good with what you have or trade early.

        Goes without saying, but don't forward this email.

        This is your password, there are many like it but this one is yours. Once you use this password on a device, RoomBaht will remember you, but only on that device.
        Copy and paste this password. Because letâ€™s face it, no one should trust humans to make passwords:
        {otp}
        {hostname}/login

        Good Luck, Starfighter.
